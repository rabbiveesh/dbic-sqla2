  *BREAKING CHANGE*
  - Change passthrough methods for insert/update to pull any values out of a -sqla2 key
    instead of special casing ones we support.
  - Add an `upsert` method to the ResultSet component which handles resolving the PK
    constraint, and also automates RETURNING the upserted values correctly (see the docs)
